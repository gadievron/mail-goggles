# Mail Goggles
A Chrome extension that adds a thoughtful pause before sending emails by requiring users to solve math problems in Gmail.

## Features
- üßÆ **Math Challenges**: Solve 1-5 addition, subtraction, or multiplication problems before sending
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Optional Timer**: Set countdown timers that generate new problems when expired
- üåô **Night Mode**: Only active between 10 PM - 8 AM for late-hour email protection
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Settings**: Configure number of problems, difficulty, and timing options
- üéØ **Seamless Integration**: Works directly within Gmail's interface

## How It Works
When you click "Send" in Gmail, a modal appears with math problems. Only after solving all problems correctly will your email be sent. This creates a deliberate moment of engagement before important communications.

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. The extension will automatically work on Gmail

## Configuration
Click the Mail Goggles icon in Chrome's toolbar to access settings:
- **Enable/Disable**: Turn the extension on or off
- **Night Mode**: Only activate during evening/early morning hours
- **Problem Count**: Choose 1-5 math problems per challenge
- **Time Limit**: Set optional countdown timer (or disable for unlimited time)

## Usage
1. Compose your email in Gmail as normal
2. Click the "Send" button
3. Solve the displayed math problems
4. Click "Send Email" to complete transmission

The extension runs entirely locally and does not access your email content.
